# Azure Web App - Corrupted TIFF Fix

## Problem
TIFF files downloaded from Azure Web App were corrupted and couldn't be opened, while the same files worked perfectly locally.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by premature cleanup of temporary files. The original code had a race condition:

1. Flask's `send_file()` was called with a file path
2. The function returned immediately (before file was fully sent)
3. The `finally` block attempted to clean up temp files
4. Azure's file system cleaned up files while they were still being transmitted
5. Result: Corrupted/incomplete TIFF downloads

This happened more frequently on Azure due to:
- Different file system timing
- Network latency between Azure's internal services
- Different temp directory cleanup behavior

## Solution
Changed the file handling approach to read files into memory before sending:

### Before (Problematic):
```python
return send_file(
    output_path,  # File path - can be deleted before send completes
    as_attachment=True,
    download_name=output_filename,
    mimetype='image/tiff'
)
# Temp files cleaned up immediately - RACE CONDITION!
```

### After (Fixed):
```python
# Read file into memory first
with open(output_path, 'rb') as f:
    file_data = f.read()

# Clean up temp directory BEFORE sending
shutil.rmtree(temp_dir, ignore_errors=True)

# Send file from memory (BytesIO)
return send_file(
    BytesIO(file_data),
    as_attachment=True,
    download_name=output_filename,
    mimetype='image/tiff'
)
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Import BytesIO ([app.py:11](app.py#L11))
```python
from io import BytesIO
```

### 2. Modified Convert Function ([app.py:157-171](app.py#L157-L171))
- Read TIFF file into memory before sending
- Clean up temp directory immediately after reading
- Send file from BytesIO object instead of file path
- Added proper error cleanup in all paths

### 3. Fixed Type Safety ([app.py:137](app.py#L137))
- Added `file.filename` check before `secure_filename()`
- Prevents potential None type errors

## Benefits

✅ **Eliminates Race Condition**: File is in memory before cleanup
✅ **Reliable on Azure**: No dependency on file system timing
✅ **Better Error Handling**: Consistent cleanup in all code paths
✅ **Works Locally & Azure**: Same behavior in all environments
✅ **Memory Safe**: Files are cleaned up immediately after reading

## Trade-offs

### Memory Usage
- Files are temporarily loaded into memory
- For large TIFFs (100MB+), this uses more RAM
- Acceptable trade-off for reliability

### Current Limits
- Max file size: 50MB per PDF
- Max total upload: 200MB
- These limits keep memory usage reasonable

## Testing

### Local Testing
1. Refresh browser (Ctrl+R or F5)
2. Upload multiple PDFs
3. Convert to TIFF
4. Verify file downloads and opens correctly
5. Check that temp files are cleaned up

### Azure Testing
After deploying these changes:
1. Upload the same PDFs that were failing
2. Download the TIFF file
3. Verify it opens correctly in image viewer
4. Test with multiple sizes (small, medium, large PDFs)

## Deployment to Azure

### Option 1: Git Push (If using Local Git)
```bash
git add app.py
git commit -m "Fix: Read TIFF into memory before sending to prevent corruption on Azure"
git push azure main
```

### Option 2: VS Code Azure Extension
1. Right-click on app.py
2. Select "Deploy to Web App"
3. Choose your Azure Web App

### Option 3: Azure CLI
```bash
az webapp deployment source config-local-git \
  --name your-app-name \
  --resource-group your-resource-group

git push azure main
```

### Option 4: GitHub Actions (If using GitHub)
```bash
git add app.py
git commit -m "Fix: Read TIFF into memory before sending to prevent corruption on Azure"
git push origin main
# GitHub Actions will auto-deploy
```

## Verification After Deployment

1. **Check deployment logs** in Azure Portal:
   - Go to Deployment Center → Logs
   - Verify deployment succeeded

2. **Test the application**:
   - Upload 2-3 small PDFs (< 5MB each)
   - Convert to TIFF
   - Download and open the file
   - Verify all pages are present and uncorrupted

3. **Monitor application logs**:
   - Azure Portal → Log Stream
   - Check for any errors during conversion

## Additional Notes

### Memory Considerations
If you need to handle very large files (>100MB TIFFs):

**Option A: Stream with After-Request Handler**
```python
@app.after_request
def cleanup_after_request(response):
    # Clean up after response is sent
    # (More complex implementation)
    return response
```

**Option B: Use Azure Blob Storage**
```python
# Upload to blob storage
# Return download URL
# Clean up with lifecycle policy
```

**Option C: Increase Memory Limits**
- Upgrade Azure App Service Plan
- B2 or higher recommended for large files

### Current Solution Works Best For:
- ✅ PDFs up to 50MB each
- ✅ Combined TIFFs up to 200MB
- ✅ Standard document scanning use cases
- ✅ Most business document workflows

## Support

If you still experience issues after deploying:

1. Check Azure logs for specific errors
2. Verify poppler-utils is installed via SSH
3. Test with very small PDFs (1-2 pages) first
4. Check Azure App Service Plan has sufficient memory
5. Review [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) troubleshooting section

## Summary

The fix ensures that TIFF files are fully read into memory before any cleanup occurs, eliminating the race condition that caused file corruption on Azure Web App. This approach is reliable, works consistently across environments, and properly handles all error cases.
